1. A laptop or a chrombook with its charger **(No iPads)**
2. A videoconference software called `Zoom` must be installed on that computer. To install the software, please [**click here**](https://zoom.us/download)

If you face some difficulties that cannot fulfill one or both of the requirements above, please contact me via email at `yihengy@graceallstaracademy.com` or [**click here**]() so we can get fully prepared for your kids before the first day starts.
